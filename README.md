# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project (Cyclistic) - Scottie Szewczyk

This page contains my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. For this project, I analyzed 12 months of ride data, encompassing more than 5 million observations, for a fictional rideshare bicycle company called Cyclistic.

**The goal of this analysis was to understand how annual Members and Guest riders used the companyâ€™s bikes differently.**

In order to showcase my capabilities with different software, I completed the project multiple times, using different tools each time:

1) **R programming:** First, I conducted the data analysis and created the visualizations entirely in R Studio. My R script can be found by opening the Markdown file szewczyk_google_capstone_R.md

2) **Python:** Next, I conducted the analysis and created the visualizations again using Python. My Python script can be found by opening the Jupyter Notebook file szewczyk_Google_Capstone_python.ipynb

3) **SQL** and 

    A. **Tableau:** When I completed the project again, I conducted the data analysis in SQL, using Google's BigQuery service, and created the visualizations in Tableau. My SQL script can be found by clicking the "SQL Script" link above, and my Tableau visualizations can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/scottie.szewczyk/viz/Szewczyk-CyclisticProject/Szewczyk-CyclisticProject

    B. **Power BI:** After conducting the analysis in SQL, I also created visualizations in Power BI. A PDF of my Power BI visualizations can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UPkypyscA2J1XbR4ja4Fvt8Vw-mSYvfN/view?usp=sharing (the PDF does not allow you to click on the buttons on the title page, but you can simply scroll through the document to see all of the visualizations).

_**Please note that the analyses and, thus, results for all of these methods are exactly the same (the Tableau document, however, includes two visualizations that are not found in the other documents). Completing the project multiple times was simply a way for me to showcase my skillset and improve my understanding of these tools.**_
